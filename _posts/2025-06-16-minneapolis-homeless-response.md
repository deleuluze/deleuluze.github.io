title: we do this to us: the violent liberal response to homelessness in Minneapolis
slug: minneapolis-homelessness

These thoughts are in response to an interview that Brian O’Hara, the chief of police in Minneapolis, had on MPR. In this interview, he said “we are relying on neighbors in almost every case” in stopping encampments from forming (MPR, 04/02/2025). 
Minneapolis has shifted its homelessness “strategy” from violently destroying encampments to preventing them from being formed in the first place. This works, in practice, through the use of increased police presence that ensures that unhoused people are not in one spot for too long. Unhoused people who congregate in small numbers are routined harassed and surveilled by this increased police presence. 

Let’s be clear: the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey (a democrat) and Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O’Hara’s new response is an insidious form of violence. Homelessness may be less visible to the general population, but this hidenness obscures the very real violence of this city-wide response. 

What about us makes us call the police on our unhoused neighbors? Is it a sense that it will lead to better outcomes for the unhoused individual? 

Or is it that we view ourselves as superior to our neighbor and view them as the Other? Is it a fear that they aren’t “responsible” enough, that they are “troublemakers,” that they deep-down deserve the situation they are in?

And what happens affectively when we call the police? What do we get out of it emotionally?

Perhaps a sense of justice? Perhaps we like following the rules and social norms? Or perhaps, and even more insidiously, we get a feeling of perverse joy when exerting power and fascistic desire over those in a different position than ourselves? 

The next time you see something, no you didn’t. The city is relying on “good liberals” who call the police on their unhoused neighbors. Police then use this information to harass, displace, and kill our unhoused neighbors. 

Exorcise the inner police inside you and go about your day.
